📌 Problem Statement

Amazon operates at massive scale with millions of products and customer interactions occurring every day. Accurately understanding customer behavior and predicting product demand or relevance is critical for improving user experience, optimizing inventory, and driving business decisions.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning solution that analyzes historical product and interaction data to predict key outcomes such as demand trends, product relevance, or recommendation likelihood. The system must handle large, noisy, and real-world datasets while maintaining strong generalization on unseen data.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze structured product and interaction datasets

Perform effective data preprocessing and feature engineering

Train and evaluate machine learning models for accurate prediction

Optimize performance using appropriate evaluation metrics

Ensure scalability and robustness

📂 Input

Product metadata (category, price, ratings, etc.)

User interaction data (views, clicks, purchases)

Temporal and contextual features

📤 Output

Predicted demand / relevance scores

Model performance metrics (Accuracy, F1, RMSE, etc.)
